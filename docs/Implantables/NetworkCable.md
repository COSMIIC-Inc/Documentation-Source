## Component Overview
 
![image](./img/graphic-blue-connector.png)

The Network Cable is the conduit for conducting power and communications between implanted modules in the COSMIIC System. Power on the Network Cable is provided by connection to the Power Module's rechargeable battery. Network communication can be generated on the  Network Cable by any module. The Network Cable is a critical component of the COSMIIC System because all remote modules depend on its proper functioning for power and communication. Every remote module must be connected to the COSMIIC System network through a Network Cable.

## Technical Description
The design of the Network Cables combines the features of low electrical resistance with strength and durability. The Network Cable must conduct the power and communication signal without significant losses and must have excellent fatigue resistance for placement in the extremities where the cable may cross multiple joints.

The Network Cable is a four-filar (7-strands DFT each), two-conductor cable. It is terminated at each end with an identical male connector for connection to any module in the COSMIIC System. The Network Cable is designed to be easy to connect and disconnect in surgery, yet maintain physical and electrical conduction at the connector within the body for the lifetime of the individual. It is possible to replace each component of the COSMIIC System, including individual modules or network cables, without disrupting the remaining implanted components.  

The total length of the cable varies depending on the location in the body, but is typically 10-30cm. Strain relief is provided at each end of the cable for durability and to provide stiffness for insertion into each module.
