# Port Plugs

Protecting the port connections

---

## Component Overview

The Power Module header has two network ports and Remote Module headers have four network ports and four electrode cable ports. These header ports are closed with a port plug that is placed during manufacture. Port plugs are removed at the time of surgery to accommodate connection to the Power Module or Remote Module headers.

## Technical Overview

The port plug body consists of a PEEK rod cut to length and shaped to fit into the Bal-Seal connector springs. It is overmolded with a liquid silicone rubber strain relief with dual O­‐ring. The overmold serves as the handle for placing and removing from the header ports, and the dual O-ring keeps the port plug situated in place. The overmold and dual O-ring section is dyed with biocopmatible pigment to color code. This color code helps reinforce whether a module header port is oriented for network cables or electrode cables.
