# Power Module

The control hub of our flagship system

## Product Description

![NNP Device](./img/nnp.jpg)

The	Power Module is	an	implanted	module	that	has	two	key	functions.		First,	it houses	the	
rechargeable	Li-ion	batteries	that	supply	power	to the	entire	NNP	implanted	system,	along	
with	the	required	recharging	link	and	circuitry.		Second,	it contains	the	wireless	MedRadio	
link	for	transcutaneous	communication and	system	programming.		The	power	module
connects	to	the	network	through the	network	cable,	placing power	onto	it for	distribution	to	
all	remote	modules.

The	power	module is	designed	for	easy	surgical	replacement,	and	replacement	is	an	
anticipated	and	expected	event	based	on	the	eventual	depletion	of	the	Li-ion	batteries.		
Power	module replacement	is	accomplished	through	a	single	small	incision,	disconnection	
of	the	network	segment	connection,	and	replacement	with	a	new	power	module.		This	
procedure	is	expected	to	be	an	outpatient	procedure	requiring	less	than	30	minutes.
The	power	module is	designed	to	be	implanted	in	the	torso,	typically	either	chest	or	
abdomen,	because	these	portions	of	the	body	can	accommodate	the power	module package	
size.		This	location	also	allows	convenient	access	for	recharging	through	an	inductive	link,	
and	easy	surgical	exposure	for	replacement.

The	power	module contains	a	magnetically	activated	switch	for	emergency	shut-down	of	
the	entire	NNP	system.		This	switch	implements	a	failsafe	shutdown	function	that	will	deenergize	all	of	the	power	module	circuitry	in	the	presence	of	a	strong,	static	magnetic	field.		
The	power	module utilizes	a	32	bit	ARM-7	microprocessor,	the	NXP	Semiconductor	
LPC2129	processor.		The	processor	runs	a	real	time	operating	system	(RTOS).
During	functional	operation,	the	power	module primarily	functions	as	the	power	source	for	
the	entire	implanted	NNP	system.		However,	due	to	its significant	processing	power,	it	is	capable	of	performing	signal	processing	and	data	storage	in	support	of	the	remote	module	
functions	when	required.		The	power	module is	always	active	(except	under	the	emergency	
shut-down	condition),	but	can	be	placed	into	and	taken	out	of	a	low-power		‘sleep’	mode	by	
the	user.	

The	power	module has	a	titanium case	with	feedthroughs	for	the	network	connections	and	
antenna	wire. An epoxy header	holds	the	connections	and	antenna.		A	polymer	nest	inside	
the	case	holds	the	batteries	and	circuitry	in	place.		The	coil	for	inductive	battery	recharging	
surrounds	the	circuitry	inside	the	case.		Three	identical	Li-ion	rechargeable	cells	are	
connected	in	parallel	to	provide	the	NNP	system	power.
