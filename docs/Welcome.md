### What is COSMIIC?

A resource to go from theory to therapy in neuromodulation without recreating the wheel.

COSMIIC is establishing an open source ecosystem of users and resources surrounding a unique active implantable device ready for use in fundamental neuroscience, animal, and early feasibility human research.

The COSMIIC System is based on the Networked Neuroprosthetic (NNP) System, which was invented at Case Western Reserve University. COSMIIC is currently an NIH SPARC-funded project to open access to this device for the entire field of neuromodulation R&D and will eventually transition into a distributed, collaborative community. Our open source concept includes all aspects of the implantable system that are necessary for pre-clinical and human use&mdash;hardware, software, mechanical components, test documents, and regulatory documents&mdash;with the hope that access leads to more human therapies.
